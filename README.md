# CS-112 Project

This project uses the concepts of Object Oriented Programming to create an Auction System for Pakistan Super League, a world-wide famous Cricket League. 

# Inheritance and Polymorphism

The Project tries to help us practice with Diamond problems as such where the All-Rounder Class is derived from both the Batsmen and Bowler classes which are already derived from a Parent Class, Players.

# Bidding Process 

The bidding process included past topics we learnt such as rand() functions to generate a 6 figure random bid made by another Cricket Team. Furthermore, it also used polymorphism and file handling to display the Players available to bid on.
